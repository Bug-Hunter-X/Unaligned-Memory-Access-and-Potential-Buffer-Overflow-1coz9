This repository contains an example of a common error in assembly programming: unaligned memory access and potential buffer overflow.  The `bug.asm` file demonstrates the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version. The issue stems from directly accessing memory at `ebx+4` without proper alignment checks or bounds verification, leading to potential crashes or unexpected data corruption.  The solution demonstrates safe practices to mitigate these issues.
